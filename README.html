<p>All of the below notes come without any warranty, implied or explicit. YAYOR. The instructions worked on my
OSX 10.8.5 box and may or may not work anywhere else. There may be omissions and typos. This is not a

<h2 id="How-To-Count-Lines-in-a-Block-Tag">How To Count Lines in a Block Tag</h2>

<p>There are situations where you need to know just how many lines of text a given element on a web contains.
This is surprisingly hard to do in browsers. There are lots and lots of suggestions for counting lines;
a quick search turns up a long list:</p>

<ul>
<li>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14375971/find-the-number-of-lines-in-a-div</li>
<li>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/783899/how-can-i-count-text-lines-inside-an-dom-element-can-i</li>

<li>https://forum.jquery.com/topic/can-jquery-detect-how-many-lines-of-text-within-a-div-or-a-tag</li>
</ul>


<p>There are also some libraries to do such things as typesetting in columns and shortening texts where
knowledge about precise text dimensions is necessary, including</p>

<ul>
<li>https://github.com/theproductguy/ThreeDots/blob/master/js/jquery.ThreeDots.js</li>
<li>https://github.com/ftlabs/ftcolumnflow</li>
</ul>


<p>Most of these solutions rely on clever techniques to add and remove text, measure font metrics and doing
clever CSS guesstimations. One of the most prevalent and promising techniques consists in somehow obtaining
the height of a single line and then dividing the height of a DOM container with that value. In order
for that to work, your lines be better all of the same height and the DOM metrics precise.</p>

<p>There is, however, a much more elegant and reliable solution that relies on the <code>getClientRects()</code> method
of DOM nodes, as explained in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getClientRects.
At first, hwoever, the reader gets frustrated by the follwoing remark:</p>

<blockquote><p>Originally, Microsoft intended this method to return a TextRectangle object for each line of text.
However, the CSSOM working draft specifies that it returns a ClientRect for each border box.</p></blockquote>

<p>Awww, snap. There's a surprising number of discussion on the web that stop consider <code>getClientRects</code> at this
point, stating that "the solution will only work in IE". But, reading on, that's not quite true:</p>

<blockquote><p>For an inline
element, the two definitions are the same. But for a block element, Mozilla will return only a single
rectangle.</p></blockquote>

<p>Luckily, this cryptic message is better borne out by the accompanying illustration:</p>

<p><img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/3108/paragraph-rects.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>From this, it is a small step to arrive at what i currently <strong>the most elegant and reliable way to count
lines of text in a DOM block element as rendered by a given browser</strong>, namely: <strong>(1)</strong> wrap the contents
of the relevant block element(s) in an inline element (say, <code>&lt;span class="line-counter"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;</code>); <strong>(2)</strong>
retrieve the DOM node(s) of this or those element(s); <strong>(3)</strong> call <code>span.getClientRects().length</code> to
find the line count(s). Step (1) can easily done dynamically using jQuery's <code>wrapInner()</code> method; sample
code:</p>

<pre><code class="js">var block_nodes   = $( 'p' ); // or however you get your relevant block nodes
block_nodes.wrapInner( '&lt;span class="line-counter"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;' );
// Get line count for first `&lt;p&gt;` tag:
var line_counter  = block_nodes.eq( 0 ).children( '.line-counter' )[ 1 ];
var line_count    = line_counter.getClientRects().length;
</code></pre>

<p><strike>As of 2015-01-14, there are three open pull request to support io.js with <code>n</code> (see https://github.com/tj/n/pulls?q=io).
I've forked and updated <code>n</code> to <a href="https://github.com/tj/n/pull/214">implement PR 214</a>, which you can get as
git clone https://github.com/loveencounterflow/n.git cd n make install After that, you can install iojs with
n --io v1.0.1</strike></p>

<p><strike>Please keep in mind that i will not update the repo so you're probably better off using the official <code>n</code>
repo; i'd fully expect the maintainers to implement iojs support within days. Also note that the author
of PR 214 warns that his fix "makes a weak assumption that nodejs and iojs versions don't collide"; given
the speed of NodeJS updates during the past year, i believe we can safely assume that we're weeks or months
away from any NodeJS 0.12.x release, let alone NodeJS 1.x.x, so PR 214 should be good enough for now.</strike></p>

<h3 id="Solving-that-Compiliation-Issue">Solving that Compiliation Issue</h3>

<p>One great thing about NodeJS / iojs is that you can do a <em>lot</em> in plain
JavaScript, meaning you get a high degree of portability with your software.</p>

<p>However, there is also quite a number of important modules like say, <code>levelup</code>
and <code>fuse-bindings</code>, that need some C code to compile upon installation. This
can suck a lot when you have to use multiple versions of NodeJS at the same time;
for example, i'm using NodeJS 0.12.x for most things, but have some legacy stuff that
needs 0.10.x, and my NWJS app uses iojs v2.3.1, so i often have to switch versions.</p>

<p>Switching versions is easy when you use <code>n</code>, but too often compilation steps will
fail. When you try to install a module and you get this error message:</p>

<pre><code>gyp ERR! stack Error: 404 response downloading https://nodejs.org/dist/v2.4.0/node-v2.4.0.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<p>you know you're <code>gyp</code> version is wrong. The easiest way to fix that is to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp-install">use
<code>node-gyp-install</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>npm install -g node-gyp-install
node-gyp-install
</code></pre>

<p>After that, re-try to <code>npm install &lt;whatever></code>, and it <em>should</em> work!</p>

<h3 id="For-the-Cautious-Use-a-VM-to-try-out-io-js">For the Cautious: Use a VM to try out io.js</h3>

<p>You may have heard of <a href="https://iojs.org/">io.js, a forward-thinking port of NodeJS</a>. If you're on OSX then
downloading and opening the installer <code>*.pkg</code> will greet you with a message saying that it will not only
install the <code>iojs</code> binary, it will also symlink <code>node</code> to <code>iojs</code>. Depending on a lot of things you may or
may not want to take the risk. An unanswered question is how Node version managers will react to the
situation.</p>

<p>For sure to just try out io.js a virtual machine would be a better option, at least for the time being. And
it's quite easy to do:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">mkdir iojs
cd iojs
vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
</code></pre>

<p>Next, avail yourself of the current iojs tar package; i did that using the browser on the host and putting
the <code>iojs-v1.0.1-linux-x64.tar.xz</code> archive into the <code>iojs</code> folder, which from inside the guest is
accessible as <code>cd /vagrant</code>. From there, unpack files and issue four <code>mv</code> moves:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">sudo chown -R vagrant:vagrant /usr/local
cd /vagrant
tar xvfJ iojs-v1.0.1-linux-x64.tar.xz
mv /vagrant/iojs-v1.0.1-linux-x64/bin/iojs          /usr/local/bin/
mv /vagrant/iojs-v1.0.1-linux-x64/bin/node          /usr/local/bin/
mv /vagrant/iojs-v1.0.1-linux-x64/bin/npm           /usr/local/bin/
mv /vagrant/iojs-v1.0.1-linux-x64/lib/node_modules  /usr/local/lib/
</code></pre>

<p>That's it! Test it with, e.g.,</p>

<pre><code class="bash">npm install -g coffee-script
</code></pre>

<p>As i said, this is a 'forward' thinking NodeJS fork, and indeed, we have generators without any command line
flag. From the <code>coffee</code> REPL:</p>

<pre><code class="coffee">process.versions
  # { http_parser: '2.3',
  #   node: '1.0.1',
  #   v8: '3.31.74.1',
  #   uv: '1.2.0',
  #   zlib: '1.2.8',
  #   ares: '1.10.0-DEV',
  #   modules: '42',
  #   openssl: '1.0.1k' }
g = -&gt; yield 42
g().next()

<p>Grab an installer at https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html and run it. Then, create a folder of your

setup of one specific VM and acts as the synced (shared) folder that allows simple data exchange between
guest and host. From the terminal, <code>cd</code> into that folder, choose a VM name from https://vagrantcloud.com/
and install everything (which should take a minute or two).</p>

<h3 id="Installing-slap-Remarks-on-Installing-Node-npm">Installing slap; Remarks on Installing Node, npm</h3>

<blockquote><p>First written as experience report as https://github.com/slap-editor/slap/issues/228</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://github.com/slap-editor/slap/issues/228">slap</a> is a Sublime-like
editor that runs in the terminal; I first found myself unable to install
it properly until I found out my NodeJS installation—more specifically: my global
modules folder—was kind of borked. The following contains some advice for NodeJS
nಠಠbs and everyone who experiences failure when trying to <code>npm install -g</code>
something.</p>

<p><strong>1: Install NodeJS</strong></p>

<p>First of all, slap appears to be compatible (so far) with the newest NodeJS (v5 as of this writing). To me, the painlessest way to get the newest versions of Nodejs, <code>npm</code> and <code>n</code> (NodeJS version management, highly recommended) is to follow the outline in <a href="https://github.com/loveencounterflow/how-to#install-node-n-own-your-files">my how-to</a>; roughly, clone <code>n</code>, build it, and use it once to get the newest NodeJS (should come with <code>npm</code> v3):</p>

<pre><code class="bash">git clone https://github.com/visionmedia/n
cd n
sudo chown -R &lt;user>:&lt;user> /usr/local
make install
n latest
n stable
</code></pre>

<p>I write this because people always ask how to best install NodeJS. Debianists and Ubuntuers <strong>don't let their friends install NodeJS with <code>apt-get</code></strong>—that will get you an outdated version, naming conflicts, insane file rights setups, what have you.</p>

<p><strong>2: Cleanup Global NPM Modules</strong></p>

<p>This one's a biggy: In case you've been running NodeJS for as long as I have, you'll likely have ooogles of global modules installed over the years. Given the fast evolution of both Node and <code>npm</code>, there's bound to be some bit rot, so it's time to clear up that space. I was unable to install slap and got all kinds of weird errors until I resolved to <strong>manually remove my <code>~/npm/lib/node_modules</code> folder</strong> (actually I renamed it for reference and created a new <code>node_modules</code>).</p>

<p><strong>3: Install slap</strong></p>

<p>The official slap docs recommend to <code>sudo npm install -g slap@latest</code>. Not sure whether that <code>sudo</code> gives you important stuff that you don't get without (readers please fill me out on that one), but, generally speaking, the majority of people living on planet NodeJS prefer <strong>user-owned installs</strong>, <strong>user-owned <code>/usr/local</code> directories</strong>, and so on. <strong>This also happens to be the way of <code>homebrew</code>, and is generally considered A Good Idea</strong>. For this reason, i just did</p>

<pre><code class="bash">npm install -g slap

<p>which appears to work. Again, not sure what <code>slap@latest</code> gives you that you don't get without it; most of the time, you don't add version markers to <code>npm install</code>.</p>

<blockquote><p>It <em>may</em> occur that some <code>package.json</code> does specify an outdated version which will inadvertently keep you from upgrading to the next major version of some package. That <em>shouldn't</em> happen here (not quite sure: do get global packages an entry in a global <code>package.json</code>?) but just to stay on the safe side, you can always <code>npm uninstall --save xxx &amp;&amp; npm install --save xxx</code> a package to obtain the latest version (the <code>--save</code> switch produces a suitable entry in the package's <code>package.json</code>), even across major versions (yes yes I know there are simpler ways but this one is really obvious and memorable).</p></blockquote>

<p>I can strongly recommend to <a href="https://github.com/dylang/npm-check"><code>npm install -g npm-check</code></a>, which will give you the greatest way to control <code>npm</code> dependencies. <code>npm-check -u</code> gives you an interactive prompt for project-local files (with list selection! and install-now option!!); <code>npm-check -u -g</code> does the same for global modules (including slap and, behold, <code>npm</code> itself!!).</p>

<h3 id="Update-Install-CoffeeScript-with-Generators-and-yield"><em>Update</em> Install CoffeeScript with Generators and <code>yield</code></h3>

<p><strong>As of 2015-01-29, CoffeeScript v1.9.1 has generators / <code>yield</code> support baked right into the
mainstream distribution, meaning whereever you <code>npm install coffee-script</code>, you wild get
support for this exciting feature (of course, provided your JS VM also supports it).
For the details, have a look at
https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/compare/1.8.0...1.9.0
or
http://coffeescript.org/#changelog.</strong></p>

<p><strike>As of this writing, <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> is at 1.8.0 and comes without (obvious) support for
the <code>yield</code> keyword (have a look at my outdated patch i dubbed <a href="https://github.com/loveencounterflow/coffy-script">CoffyScript</a>;
the readme is a quite detailed explanation of generators and what you can do with them to get much nicer
ways to cope with asynchronicity in JavaScript.)</strike></p>

<p><strike>The great folks over there at CS have managed to get <code>yield</code> support into CoffeeScript, but it's still
hidden behind a not-obvious installation trick; all you have to do is</strike></p>

<p><strike>...</strike></p>

<p>With that version of CS installed, you can now try this:</p>

<pre><code class="coffee">g = -&gt;
  yield 42
  yield 108

f = g()
log f.next()
log f.next()
log f.next()
</code></pre>

<p>While this does not look like anything useful on first sight, it opens a whole new world of possibilities
for some very important classes of problems. Again, head over to the readme mentioned above and don't forget
it's obsolete and in need of a re-write; you should be able to run everything, but <strong>avoid the star</strong> when
using CoffeeScript (it's implicit now. <strong>Update</strong> code samples corrected, but it still shows up in the text).
Also, remember to run your scripts with <code>node --harmony ...</code> (as of NodeJS 0.11.14).</p>

<h3 id="Create-a-Mapped-Port">Create a Mapped Port</h3>

<p>If you plan to run a server of whatever kind inside your shiny new Vagrant VM, you probably also want to
make that server visible from the host. One to accomplish that is to set up a forwarded port. Let's open
the host's <code>Vagrantfile</code> in an editor to do that:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">cd drifter
open -t ./Vagrantfile
</code></pre>

<p>In the Vagrantfile, look for an outcommented line like the below, uncomment it and choose the appropriate
settings. In my case, i chose to map the guest's port 3000 to the same port on the host, so i can run
the same software in the host or in the VM. Keep in mind though that a VM with such a setting running
in the background will cause host applications trying to offer connectivity on that very port to fail (more
or less) silently.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 3000, host: 3000
</code></pre>

<h3 id="Enabling-NFS-for-Synced-a-k-a-Shared-Folder">Enabling NFS for Synced (a.k.a. Shared) Folder</h3>

<p>My use case for setting up a Vagrant VM is that i want to use NodeJS 0.11.x as much as possible, as it
offers generators when started with the <code>--harmony</code> switch. Unfortunately, you can't at this time (December,
2014) <code>npm install level</code> under NodeJS > 0.10.x, so it's going to be difficult if your whole application
relies on new-fangled stuff like <code>yield</code>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, though, setting up VMs has become very fast and straightforward, and networking (think
bi-directional WebSockets) has evolved a lot, so you can always create a separate environment with bespoke
dependencies, and this is exactly what i need.</p>

<p>At some point when i hoped i had everything up and running:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>n 0.10.35</code>; NodeJS correct version? Check!</li>
<li><code>npm install level</code>; LevelDB binaries compiled? Check!</li>
<li><code>require 'level'; db = level '../data/mydb'</code>; LevelDB instance fine? Check!</li>
<li>Let's put a value into the DB with <code>db.put key, value ( error ) -&gt; ...</code>. OAWH:</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="bash">OpenError: IO error: ./users.db/MANIFEST-000001: Invalid argument
</code></pre>

<p>Turns out the underlying VirtualBox implementation has known issues with <code>mmap</code>ped files that LevelDB
relies on. Fortunately, there's a workaround: use an NFS (Network File System) share.</p>

<p>On the host, try <code>sudo nfsd status</code>; you should see an output like</p>

<pre><code class="bash">nfsd service is enabled
nfsd is running (pid 2140, 8 threads)
</code></pre>

<p>You may have to <code>sudo nfsd enable</code>, and/or <code>sudo touch /etc/exports</code>, and/or <code>sudo nfsd start</code>, and/or
reboot to get the NFS demon to run.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that Vagrant may try to access <code>/etc/exports</code> when starting up; if you started without
<code>sudo</code>, you will be asked to enter your password. That's your user password on the <em>host</em>, not the one
on the <em>guest</em> (which you do not know, as all authentication on the guest is done implicitly).</p>

<p>Then, in the <code>Vagrantfile</code>, look for the below settings and edit them; i chose to overwrite the existing
setting in the first case (so i get an NFS share for the standard shared folder, which is
the folder the <code>Vagrantfile</code> resides in on the host, and <code>/vagrant</code> on the guest), and to use the default
suggestion for the second case.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is
  # the path on the host to the actual folder. The second argument is
  # the path on the guest to mount the folder. And the optional third
  # argument is a set of non-required options.
  config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant", type: "nfs"

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"

<p>While there's a lot of software that you can and should install on Debianish /
Ubuntish systems, there's also a number of software titles you should definitely
<em>not</em> install that way; examples include</p>

<ul>
<li><p>NodeJS, which will always be outdated when installed via <code>apt</code>, will get
the wrong name (<code>nodejs</code> instead of <code>node</code>), and will not give you the opportunity
to just-so switch between versions as you can with <code>n</code> or <code>nvm</code>;</p></li>
<li><p>Open/LibreOffice; as <a href="https://github.com/loveencounterflow/coffeelibre#remarks-for-running-aoo-on-ubuntu">I argue in the Readme about Writing macros for LibreOffice with
Coffeescript</a>,
OpenOffice in Ubuntu is annoyingly broken and somewhat hard to replace with
a reasonable LibreOffice installation;</p></li>
<li><p>and, sadly, TeX Live. Turns out while you can choose between a 'basic' and a 'full'
installation of TeX Live using <code>apt-get</code>, neither will be 'as full' as the one
that'd get with the official TeX Live download. Case in point: a command like
<code>tlmgr info xcolor</code> is going to fail miserably with an <code>apt</code> installation
of TeX Live, and <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/137428/tlmgr-cannot-setup-tlpdb">there seems to be no easy way to fix that</a>.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I recommend using https://github.com/scottkosty/install-tl-ubuntu instead; you can just clone
the repo to some <code>tmp</code> location and run the install script with <code>sudo ./install-tl-ubuntu</code>,
very simple.</p>

<h1>APPLICATION PROGRAMMING</h1>

<h2 id="How-to-Keep-Order-in-an-Asynchronous-World">How to Keep Order in an Asynchronous World</h2>

<h3 id="The-Problem">The Problem</h3>

<p>You use NodeJS streams and pipes to read data from a database; let's assume you have a collection of flight
connection data and want to sort by price, show up to 10 connections, and exclude all flights the are priced
above a certain <code>limit</code>. In principle, your setup could look similar to this:</p>

<pre><code class="coffee">( db.create_readstream query )
  .pipe filter ( id, price ) -&gt; return price &lt; limit
  .pipe sort_by_price_ascending
  .pipe at_most 10
  .pipe output
</code></pre>

<p>The way we have set up things means <code>output</code> will contain a list of up to 10 flight IDs and prices, sorted
with the cheapest flights first. That's fine, but also a little spartanic. Luckily, you've got a stream
transformer <code>find_details</code> that will take a flight ID, send a request to the database or a website to fill
out the many pertinent details that people want to know before booking. You stick that transformer into
your pipeline and are (...almost) good to go:</p>

<pre><code class="coffee">( db.create_readstream query )
  .pipe filter ( id, price ) -&gt; return price &lt; limit
  .pipe sort_by_price_ascending
  .pipe at_most 10
  .pipe find_details
  .pipe output
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, since DB and HTTP requests are inherently asynchronous in NodeJS, this means you just
destroyed the ordering of your results. In this case it wouldn't be a big deal, since we'd only have to
resort a dozen pieces, but in the actual use case that this model use case is based on i had tens of
thousands of data items. My workaround was to cache the responses of the details query in a list, and when
the stream signalled it was done, i sorted the list and re-sent each item one by one.</p>

<p>This is not only annoying from a theoretical point of view (ideally, streams should manage pieces one by one
and avoid buffering where possible), it also means more memory consumption and poorer performance. And it
entails you'll have to look for yet another workaround if the amount of data to be processed should ever
outgrow available RAM. Can't we make it so that the pieces of data in the stream somehow keep the order in
which the requests got <em>sent</em>, not the order in which the responses <em>arrived</em>?</p>

<h3 id="The-Solution">The Solution</h3>

<p>So i thought about building a list structure—a queue—of requests that i would then match with asynchronous
responses as they come in; whenever the oldest item in the request queue gets matched with an item in the
response queue, then sending the response into the stream and deleting request and response from their
queues would be safe. Less buffering, ordering preserved. Yay.</p>

<p>Turns out this functionality is already available as <a href="http://highlandjs.org/#parallel">highland.js/parallel</a>:</p>

<pre><code class="coffee">_           = require 'highland'
concurrency = 5

_ ( db.create_readstream query )
  .pipe     filter ( id, price ) -&gt; return price &lt; limit
  .pipe     sort_by_price_ascending
  .pipe     at_most 10
  .map      find_details
  .parallel concurrency # send up to 5 requests at the same time
  .pipe     output
</code></pre>

<p>The key here is to use Highland's <code>map</code> and <code>parallel</code> stream methods in tandem.</p>

<h2 id="Cycling-through-Firefox-Tabs-in-Most-Recently-Used-MRU-Order">Cycling through Firefox Tabs in Most Recently Used (MRU) Order</h2>

<p>Annoyingly, Firefox uses 'linear' tab switching be default, meaning
that when you <code>ctrl+tab</code> to another tab and then <code>ctrl+tab</code> again,
you'll not get back to to the original tab but to the next tab in the
row. You can fix that by going to <code>about:config</code> (type it into the
address bar), then searching for the entry <code>browser.ctrlTab.previews</code>
(typing <code>ctrlt</code> into the search field does it). Double-click that entry
to change it to <code>true</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.httrack.com/">HtTrack</a> is a great tool but it doesn't take kindly
to <a href="https://web.archive.org">Archive.Org</a>'s' URL structure. The problem is that
(1) whenever the WayBack Machine crawls a website and makes a snapshot, that
snapshot will only include URLs that are different from the last snapshot; (2)
those changed addresses will be made accessible to the world under a URL that
starts with https://web.archive.org/web/, then has a timestamp looking like
<code>20160907003604</code>, followed by the mirrored site's URL.</p>

<p>When you click your way through the mirrored site, you will often jump between
timestamps. Now you <em>can</em> use HtTrack with wildcards, like so:</p>

<pre><code>httrack https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://example.com/index.cfm --robots=N --max-rate=3000
</code></pre>

<p>and this does work in principle, <strong>but</strong> what you'll get is a long, looooong list of timestamped
folders with tiny bits of data in each one, which makes it almost impossible to use.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Linux kernel enumerates the states for the J1900 as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>0 POLL</li>
<li>1 C1-BYT</li>
<li>2 C6N-BYT</li>
<li>3 C6S-BYT</li>
<li>4 C7-BYT</li>
<li>5 C7S-BYT</li>
</ul>


<p>The parameter intel_idle.max_cstate refers to that enumeration and does <em>NOT</em> conform to the Intel
notation of the C-states (which confused me):</p>

<p>So "intel_idle.max_cstate=2" means POLL, C1-BYT, and C6N-BYT (the first of the intel C6 states) are
enabled and all other states (C6S-BYT, C7-BYT, C7S-BYT) are disabled and <em>CANNOT</em> be enabled after boot
time.</p>

<p>Fortunately the /sys interface of the kernel allows fine-grained tweeking at run-time and one can turn off
and on the the states individually (if not disabled at boot time via intel_idle.max_cstate=<var>number</var>).</p>

<p>In order to investigate whether erratum VLP52 is the root cause for this kernel bug (109051) I attached
two shell scripts to this bug.</p>

<p>The first (c6off+c7on.sh) will disable all intel C6 core states for Baytrail processors (C6N-BYT and
C6S-BYT) + enable all C7 core states (C7-BYT and C7S-BYT).</p>

<p>The second script can be used to verify that the C6 states are disabled (column "Disabled" should show a
"1" for the disabled states and the count for the columns "Time" and "Usage" should not change any longer
for the disabled C6*-BYT states).</p>

<p>The "c6off+c7on.sh" script should be started at system boot and if erratum VLP52 is the root cause of this
bug then Baytrail systems with the processors mentioned in
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=109051#c425 (J2850, J1850, J1750, N3510, N2810, N2805, N2910,
N3520, N2920, N2820, N2806, N2815, J2900, J1900, J1800, N3530, N2930, N2830, N2807, N3540, N2940, N2840,
N2808) should run stably again. Especially Baytrail based systems with low average load (e.g. tablets and
notebooks) should consume considerably less power with enabled C7*-BYT states.</p></blockquote>
